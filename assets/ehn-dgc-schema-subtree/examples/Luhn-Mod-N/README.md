# Luhn-Mod-N 
This is a Luhn-Mod-N implementation in Python, based on the original Wikipedia 
article at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_mod_N_algorithm.

## Pre-requisites

The Luhn-Mod-N implementation has no other requirements than Python 3.

The `usage.py` sample makes use of 
[f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings), 
so you will need Python 3.6 or later if you wish to run the sample usage script.

## Sample usage
`python usage.py`

## Implementation 
One file: `luhn_mod_n.py`. 

The codeset defined in `_CODE_POINTS` is for the European Union (EU) 
eHealthNetwork (eHN) Digital Covid Certificate (DCC).
